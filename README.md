# Simple Calculator

This is a simple text-based calculator program written in C++. The program reads a mathematical expression as input and processes it accordingly. Unit tests are also included using the Catch2 framework.

## Features

- Processes mathematical expressions from user input.
- Includes unit tests to verify functionality.
- Command-line interface.
- Supports basic operations (currently, only input processing).

## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) framework for unit testing.

## Building the Program

To build the program, ensure that you have `CMake` installed, and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
